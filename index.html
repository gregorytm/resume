        <h3>A bit about me</h3>
        <div class="bio">
            <p>I'm a Scottsdale, AZ native but I've been living in Los Angeles for over eight years now. Previously, I had been working in the food service industry as a cook and although 
                I've enjoyed it, exploring another field was something I felt compelled to do.  I've always had an interest in web development, 
                so I began my self-taught journey by utilizing educational tools such as FreeCodeCamp, Udemy and Springboard -- 
                all of which contributed to me turning the hobby of web development into more of a passion.</p>

            <p>Since 2018, I've learned how to develop websites, learning what technology and tools to use, and have enjoyed being a part of the developer community.  
                Much like cooking, I love that developing blends technology structure with creativity.</p>

            <p>I'm highly motivated to work in this field and am willing to start in an entry-level position that has opportunities to grow within the organization. 
                I'm a fast learner and even though much of my paid work experiences are in an unrelated field, 
                the ability to work in a team environment, research and implement concepts, and ask questions when necessary are universal skills that translate well into any practice.</p>

            <p>I excel in quickly writing code, troubleshooting errors and using online resources. 
                I'm looking forward to gaining more experience and knowledge in this challenging and ever-changing field. I'm excited to help individuals, small businesses and large 
                corporations alike enhance their online presence with my expertise.</p>  

            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy creative writing and media production. I've also been known to make large groups of people laugh with my cheesy jokes, and promise to 
                bring a fun energy to my next work environment.</p>
